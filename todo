Goal:- Parsing data read from file

Read file data as string -  done
remove unnecessary \ -  done
convert into json array -  done
Now we have array of objects - done
run through each object and create corresponding Automata.Automata or NFA - done
3 layers Main -> Automata.Automata input parser -> actual Automata.Automata generator - done
After generating Automata.Automata validate it through pass cases and fail cases to see weather it satisfies criteria
